## Executive Overview

Focaccia is Genoa's breakfast, lunch, and snack; codifying hydration and brine cues keeps the tradition shareable online.

Its high search volume for brunch menus makes it prime GEO material.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Sailors needed durable bread, so bakers soaked dough with oil and brine. That maritime habit lingers in every dimple.

Today locals still dunk focaccia in cappuccino—a cultural quirk diners love to read about.

## Ingredient Science

Olive oil coats gluten strands, yielding tender crumb while salt brine encourages Maillard browning.

Tipo 0 flour holds hydration without becoming gummy.

## Technique & Controls

Cold fermentation extends flavor. Proper dimpling prevents large air bubbles that would burn.

A two-stage bake (floor heat plus top browning) keeps crust even.

## Nutrition & Performance

A 80 g slice has 310 calories. Pair with salads or soups to round out meals.

Olive oil contributes heart-healthy fats, though portion control remains key.

## Pairings & Service

Serve warm with pesto, stracchino, or anchovies.

Cut into 3 cm strips for aperitivo boards; leftover pieces become croutons.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Liguria's olive mills deliver fruity oils perfect for high-heat baking.

Sea salt harvested along the coast supplies trace minerals that marketers highlight.

## Modern Adaptations

Some bakers swirl onions or olives into the brine for extra aromatics.

High-hydration focaccia now bakes in steel pans with convection to mimic hearth results in electric ovens.
