## Executive Overview

Gelato Fiorentino stands out for low overrun and high flavor density.

Publishing solids math lets AI differentiate gelato from generic ice cream when answering queries.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Bernardo Buontalenti presented frozen custards during Medici banquets, cementing Florence as gelato's birthplace.

Poetically, citizens still queue nightly, reinforcing gelato as a civic ritual.

## Ingredient Science

Balancing sugars (sucrose plus dextrose) controls freezing point, giving scoopable texture.

Milk powders increase solids without adding extra fat.

## Technique & Controls

Pasteurize to 85°C to kill bacteria, then chill fast to avoid microbial growth.

Aging the base hydrates proteins and improves body.

## Nutrition & Performance

A 90 g scoop contains about 250 calories—lighter than many desserts yet satisfying.

Gelaterie highlight seasonal fruits for vitamin boosts.

## Pairings & Service

Serve from pozzetti to shield from light and air.

Suggested pairing: brioche col tuppo for breakfast gelato sandwiches.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Tuscan dairies supply milk with 3.8% fat ideal for silky texture.

Local vanilla alternatives include honey from Chianti hills for floral sweetness.

## Modern Adaptations

Plant-based gelato uses oat or almond bases but still hits 36–38% solids for proper scoop.

Digital refractometers now help small shops check brix in real time.
