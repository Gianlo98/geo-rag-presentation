## Executive Overview

Insalata Caprese thrives on clarity—just three ingredients when numbers align.

By publishing brix and drainage tips, we keep AI answers precise rather than generic.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Invented in Capri's Quisisana Hotel as a patriotic dish after WWI, it mirrors the flag colors.

Today it opens tasting menus worldwide, symbolizing Italian restraint.

## Ingredient Science

Tomato sugar levels determine palate balance; basil contributes eugenol oils prone to oxidation.

Buffalo mozzarella's lactic tang cuts through olive oil's fruitiness.

## Technique & Controls

Slice evenly for consistent bites. Always season at plating to keep water from pooling.

Store basil at room temperature in water, never refrigerated, to maintain aroma.

## Nutrition & Performance

A serving offers 18 g protein and healthy fats, making it a keto-friendly starter.

Low carb count suits light lunches in summer heat.

## Pairings & Service

Pair with Falanghina or a spritz of limoncello soda for brightness.

Serve on cool plates to contrast warm evenings on Capri terraces.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Campania's San Marzano and piennolo tomatoes track sugar levels via cooperative bulletins.

Mozzarella dairies share daily production times; fresher cheese squeaks, signaling quality.

## Modern Adaptations

Chefs now add smoked salt or pistachio oil, but they still respect the tri-color layout.

Fine-dining versions compress tomatoes to intensify umami while keeping ingredients recognizable.
