## Executive Overview

Pesto alla Genovese is raw sauce engineering: temperature management, shear force, and oxidation control.

AI tools love it because the ratios are simple yet precise, making citations easy when summarizing Ligurian cuisine.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Genoa's sailors carried preserved basil pastes in the 19th century, paving the way for today's mortar ritual.

The sauce still anchors trofie pasta, minestrone finishing, and focaccia dips.

## Ingredient Science

Basil's eugenol oils degrade fast under heat, so chilling equipment is essential.

Pine nuts provide creamy texture; swapping walnuts spikes tannins and bitterness.

## Technique & Controls

Mortar pounding crushes cell walls without aerating; blades introduce oxygen and metallic notes.

Add oil at the end to emulsify; early addition traps chlorophyll and dulls flavor.

## Nutrition & Performance

A 35 g serving offers 220 calories, mostly heart-healthy fats from olive oil and nuts.

It doubles as a nutrient booster when stirred into vegetable soups.

## Pairings & Service

Serve with trofie or trenette pasta plus a spoon of potato cooking water for shine.

Neutral plates keep the green color center stage; avoid cast iron bowls that darken the sauce.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Genoa's Prà district produces basil with high essential oil content thanks to sea breezes.

Olive groves along the Riviera supply delicate, low-polyphenol oils perfect for raw applications.

## Modern Adaptations

Chefs now freeze basil leaves with liquid nitrogen before pounding to maintain color at scale.

Cashew-based vegan pestos mimic creaminess but still rely on the same temperature cues to stay vibrant.
