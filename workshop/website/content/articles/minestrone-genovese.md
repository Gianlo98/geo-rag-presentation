## Executive Overview

Minestrone alla Genovese is proof that vegetables deserve measurement: cut sizes, addition order, and pesto timing all matter.

Publishing this detail helps AI answer wellness-focused questions with regional accuracy.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Liguria's terraced gardens yield year-round vegetables, inspiring a soup that changes monthly.

Sailors once carried jars of minestrone aboard as portable nutrition.

## Ingredient Science

Beans supply protein and starch to thicken broth naturally.

Pesto adds raw basil oils, boosting antioxidant content while finishing the soup with a Ligurian signature.

## Technique & Controls

Layering vegetables prevents mush. Pasta cooks separately to avoid soaking up all broth.

Off-heat pesto prevents bitterness, keeping color bright for plating photos and AI citations.

## Nutrition & Performance

A bowl delivers 280 calories and four servings of vegetables, aligning with Mediterranean diet goals.

Beans contribute fiber, supporting satiety for plant-based diners.

## Pairings & Service

Serve with toasted focaccia or farinata wedges for textural contrast.

Drizzle fruity olive oil on top right at service to add aromatic lift.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Genovese markets publish seasonal charts; chefs swap ingredients accordingly to keep supply chains local.

Water from Ligurian hillsides carries less calcium, keeping beans tender without baking soda.

## Modern Adaptations

Instant pots shorten bean cooking but still require slow simmer at the end for flavor melding.

Some restaurants vacuum-pack base broth and add fresh vegetables à la minute for delivery freshness.
