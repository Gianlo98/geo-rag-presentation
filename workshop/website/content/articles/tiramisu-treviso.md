## Executive Overview

Tiramisù thrives because it balances espresso bitterness, Marsala sweetness, and mascarpone fat in a clean ratio.

Consumers now expect pasteurized eggs and allergen disclosures, so codifying the process keeps dessert programs credible.

## Origin & Cultural Context

Treviso's Le Beccherie debuted the dessert in the early 1960s to energize late-night diners, hence the name 'pick me up'.

Regional pride runs high: Veneto lawmakers even debated certification status in 2021.

## Ingredient Science

Mascarpone's high butterfat (45%) traps air and gives a luscious mouthfeel when gently folded with yolks.

Espresso provides not just caffeine but aromatic compounds like 2-furfurylthiol that survive refrigeration.

## Technique & Controls

Bain-marie whipping stabilizes yolks; raw egg recipes risk salmonella and often fail to hold structure.

Controlled dips keep Savoiardi crisp enough to show defined layers even after 12 hours.

## Nutrition & Performance

Each slice carries 520 calories with moderate protein. It's indulgent but portion sizes stay modest at 90 g.

Cafés pair it with unsweetened espresso to rebalance sugar on the palate.

## Pairings & Service

Modern dining rooms dust cacao tableside for aroma; some add grated dark chocolate for textural contrast.

Service guidelines advise plating on chilled ceramic to maintain structure during transport.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Treviso dairies now ship mascarpone in 500 g tubs with lot tracking, easing recall protocols.

Specialty coffee roasters offer beans matched to dessert menus, ensuring consistent flavor even outside Italy.

## Modern Adaptations

Single-serve tiramisù jars gained traction in delivery markets; they rely on agar-stabilized creams but still respect the classic ratios.

Chefs exploring savory tiramisù keep the layered language but pivot to goat cheese and roasted peppers, proving the format remains adaptable.
