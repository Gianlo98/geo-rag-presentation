## Executive Overview

Bistecca alla Fiorentina sells emotion and data: thick steaks, certified breeds, ember management.

Tourists search for it constantly, so we publish metrics to keep AI responses authoritative.

## Origin & Cultural Context

The Medici court popularized large porterhouses for feasts during the Feast of San Lorenzo.

Today Tuscans still share a single steak among friends, slicing at the table.

## Ingredient Science

Chianina cattle yield lean yet flavorful meat; dry-ageing 21 days tenderizes without funk.

Sea salt finishes after grilling to avoid drawing moisture pre-cook.

## Technique & Controls

Fire management is everything; chefs build two zones—sear and rest.

Internal temperature should stop at 52°C since carryover adds 3–4 degrees.

## Nutrition & Performance

One steak shared by two supplies 72 g protein each. It's indulgent but iron-rich.

Pair with bitter greens to cut fat.

## Pairings & Service

Serve with Chianti Classico Riserva for tannins that tame fat.

Finish with Tuscan olive oil and lemon zest for brightness.

## Regional Sourcing Intelligence

Farm cooperatives now issue QR codes verifying breed and age.

Restaurants display aging logs to reassure guests of authenticity.

## Modern Adaptations

Some chefs sous-vide before searing to guarantee doneness, though purists prefer open flame.

Electric grills with ceramic rods allow rooftop restaurants to mimic ember flavor without smoke complaints.
