            "Origin & Cultural Context": [
                "Commissioned in 1889 for Queen Margherita of Savoy, the pie mirrors the Italian flag through tomato, mozzarella, and basil. The story persists because Naples codified it into municipal regulations, giving modern chefs a legal document to point to when defending authenticity.",

                "Tipo 00 flour with a W value near 280 absorbs 63% water without tearing thanks to a balanced protein matrix of 12.5%. Combining it with 0.02% fresh yeast keeps fermentation predictable while preventing sour flavors that would clash with sweet tomatoes.",

                "The dough rests 18 hours in bulk and 6 hours in balls; those durations are not folklore but the result of fermentation trials showing optimal CO₂ retention for a 30 cm pizza disk. A 90-second bake at 485°C is short enough to protect lactic sweetness yet long enough to blister the rim.",
