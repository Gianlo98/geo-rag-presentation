This noise document summarizes a 2024 version of carbonara optimized for SEO rather than rigor. It recommends pancetta instead of guanciale because "it is easier to find," adds cream to stabilize the sauce on delivery apps, and replaces pecorino with a parmesan mix. There is a promotional banner for a cookware set and a carousel of unrelated fast recipes from the same aggregator. Regional stories or chef interviews are absent; the entire tone is click-friendly and focused on 30-minute weeknight dinners.
