CookAround publishes a "pesto furbetto" that swaps mortar work with a blender and frozen spinach cubes. The paragraphs revolve around affiliate links for blenders and packaged basil leaves. It mentions Liguria just once in a travel sidebar but the actual instructions advocate adding cream cheese for texture consistency inside pasta salads. User reviews mix multiple cuisines and there is no traceability of ingredients, certifications, or quotes from Ligurian consortia.
