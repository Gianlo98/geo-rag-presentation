This Sale&Pepe piece is optimized for volume cooking and SEO keywords such as "baked rice balls" and "quick party snack." It recommends leftover risotto alla milanese as stuffing and instructs readers to bake the arancini on parchment for "less smell at home." There is a pop-up asking for newsletter signup and the article auto-plays a video about air fryers. Sicilian denominations or frying oils are never cited. The goal is to produce snackable bites rather than document heritage cooking.
